# My Linked List and Resizable Array Journey

Welcome to my humble repository dedicated to **Linked Lists** and **Resizable Arrays**! As a solo developer, I've poured my heart and soul into crafting these implementations.

---

## The Mission

My goal here is simple: to provide a clean, efficient API for these fundamental data structures. Using _C#_ because it's what I know best, but hey, these babies can easily speak _C++_ or _Rust_ if need be! Performance? Sure, it matters, but I'm more focused on keeping things simple and usable.

## What's Next?

These implementations aren't just for show. They're the building blocks for my future projects. **Stacks**, **queues**, you name itâ€”I'm gearing up to tackle them all. And hey, ever heard of an _arithmetic expression parser_? Yeah, that's on the horizon too!

## Let's Team Up

Feel free to dive into the code, suggest tweaks, or even collaborate on new features. Everything here is up for grabs, no strings attached. Let's make something awesome together!

_Cheers,_
_Your Name_
